=======================

A fork of jQuery Splitter Plugin by Dave Methvin http://methvin.com/splitter/

Dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses

NOTE: This project is abandoned.
I tried to update this plugin for jQuery 1.10.2, but without success.
The size of panes seem somewhat wrong after split bars are created.

I found another splitter plugin at
http://www.dreamchain.com/split-pane/
https://github.com/shagstrom/split-pane
and I decided to go for it.
